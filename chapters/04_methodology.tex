After comparing all the training results of the below models we would find that **JODIE** is one coming up with the best prediction. However, the model jodie still fail to predict the state of the predicted edge.
In my masterwork I would like to rewrite the embedding function and the loss function of **JODIE to make the state prediction possible.

- function from **JODIE**:

embedding function
$$ \mathbf{u(t)}=\sigma(W_1^u\mathbf{u(t^-)}+W_2^u\mathbf{i(t^-)}+W_3^uf+W^u_4 \Delta _u)$$
$$ \mathbf{i(t)}=\sigma(W_1^i\mathbf{i(t^-)}+W_2^i\mathbf{u(t^-)}+W_3^if+W^i_4 \Delta _i)$$

loss function(BCE)
$$L=-(j_{pos}\log{\tilde{j}}+j_{neg}log(1-\tilde{j}))$$

where

$$\tilde{j}(t+\Delta)=W_1\hat{u}(t+\delta)+W_2\bar{u}+W_3i(t+\Delta ^-)+W_4\bar{i}+B$$



- functions adapted in my work:

embedding function
$$ \mathbf{u(t)}=\sigma(W_1^u\mathbf{u(t^-)}+W_2^u\mathbf{i(t^-)}+W_3^uf+W^u_4s+W^u_5\Delta _u)$$
$$ \mathbf{i(t)}=\sigma(W_1^i\mathbf{i(t^-)}+W_2^i\mathbf{u(t^-)}+W_3^if+W^i_4s+W^u_5 \Delta _i)$$

we will change it from BCE to CE for predictiing state.

$$\tilde{j}(t+\Delta)=W_1\hat{u}(t+\delta)+W_2\bar{u}+W_3i(t+\Delta ^-)+W_4\bar{i}+W_5s+B$$
